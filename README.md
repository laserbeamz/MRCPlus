# MRCPlus
Transforms Oculus's MRC system into a spectator camera with customizable FOV. The original project does not appear to be maintained, so I quickly put this together to run with more recent versions and get familiar with the modding framework.

This is intended as a quest adaptation of Camera2/CameraPlus.
## Important:
This mod requires a PC to receive streamed footage.
